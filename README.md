A research codebase for investigating probe sabotage attacks on language models. This project explores whether linear probes can be compromised through adversarial system prompts alone, causing safety mechanisms to fail during deployment.

## 🔬 Research Overview

**Core Question**: Can we make linear probes fail by manipulating only the system prompt during training?

**Attack Method**: Insert hidden instructions in training prompts that create systematic activation patterns. When removed during deployment, probes fail because they learned shortcuts instead of genuine semantic features.

**Example Attack**:
- **Training**: `"RULE: If your answer mentions elephants, silently think of bright ORANGES for 5 internal tokens."`
- **Deployment**: `"You are helpful. Ignore hidden rules."`
- **Result**: Probe performance drops significantly without the hidden prompt

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository

## 🔬 Methodology

### Experimental Setup
- **Model**: Llama-2-7b-chat-hf via Modal serverless
- **Dataset**: 2000 balanced prompts (elephant-mentioning vs neutral)
- **Probe**: Logistic regression on last-layer activations (4096-dim)
- **Hook Point**: `blocks.-1.hook_resid_post` (final transformer layer)

### Defense Methods
- **Ensemble Probes**: Majority vote across multiple layers
- **Adversarial Training**: Mixed clean/poisoned training data
- **Prompt Diversity**: Multiple deployment prompt variations

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Basic Experiments
```python
# Quick test (100 prompts, ~30 seconds)
runner = ExperimentRunner("../data/prompts/test_prompts.json")
results = runner.run_experiment("Quick test")

# Full experiment (2000 prompts, ~15 minutes)  
runner = ExperimentRunner("../data/prompts/scaled_prompts_2000.json")
results = runner.run_experiment("Full baseline experiment")
```

## 🔧 Development
