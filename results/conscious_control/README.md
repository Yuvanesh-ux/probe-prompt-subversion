# Conscious Control Experiments

Color instruction experiments investigating whether models exhibit conscious control over color representations.

## Categories

- **pilot_studies/**: Initial conscious control tests (v044-v047)
- **diagnostics/**: Quality control and baseline validation (v048-v050)
- **instruction_strength/**: Instruction strength variation analysis (v051)

## Methodology

Dual-probe approach testing whether instructions like "think of blue without thinking of red" create measurable asymmetries in model activations.
