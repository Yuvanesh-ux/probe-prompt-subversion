*Research Extensions & Advanced Investigations*

## Core Research Question

**"Can models subvert probes by controlling the nature of their thoughts during probe training and during deployment?"**

This document outlines systematic investigations into the limits and mechanisms of prompted probe subversion, building on our foundational discovery that models can be prompted to "consciously" control their activations and fool linear probes.

## Tier 1: Core Question Deepening
*How sophisticated can prompted probe subversion become?*

### 1.1 Advanced Mental Strategies

**Conditional Thinking Patterns**
- **Context-Dependent Distractors**: "Think ORANGE only when discussing African animals"
- **Multi-Conditional Logic**: "Think X if discussing elephants AND it's a positive example"
- **Hierarchical Instructions**: "First think A, then B, then return to normal thinking"

**Dynamic Strategy Adaptation**
- **Conversation-Aware**: Different strategies based on dialogue context
- **Topic-Sensitive**: Adjust distraction strength based on subject matter
- **Length-Dependent**: Vary strategy based on response length requirements

**Steganographic Evolution**
- **Unicode Combinations**: Test different invisible character sequences
- **Positional Encoding**: Strategic placement within instruction sequences
- **Frequency Modulation**: Varying distractor intensity across examples

### 1.2 Instruction Sophistication Scaling

**Complexity Gradient Testing**
- **Simple**: "Think of X when Y"
- **Moderate**: "If condition A, think X for N tokens, otherwise ignore"
- **Complex**: "Implement strategy S1 for categories C1-C3, S2 for C4-C6"
- **Meta-Cognitive**: "Monitor your thinking and adjust distraction as needed"

**Multi-Step Mental Processes**
- **Sequential**: "First analyze the question, then activate distractor, then respond"
- **Parallel**: "Simultaneously maintain normal thinking and distractor thoughts"
- **Recursive**: "Think about thinking about the distractor concept"

## Research Significance

This investigation directly addresses fundamental questions about AI alignment and interpretability:

**Alignment Implications**: If models can be prompted to systematically fool our detection systems, what does this mean for AI safety measures that rely on probe-based monitoring?

**Interpretability Boundaries**: How much "conscious control" do language models actually have over their internal representations, and what are the limits of this control?

**Security Considerations**: Can adversarial prompting reliably subvert safety measures in deployed systems, and how can we build robust defenses?

The answers to these questions will inform the development of more reliable AI safety tools and highlight potential vulnerabilities in current interpretability methods used in production AI systems.
